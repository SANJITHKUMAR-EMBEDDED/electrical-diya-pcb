 Electrical Diya PCB (Tutorial Project)

This is a beginner-level KiCad PCB project for an electrical diya using:
- LDR (light sensor)
- Microphone
- LED
- 3.3V Coin Cell

🔧 What I Learned
- Using KiCad for schematic and layout
- Assigning footprints and generating Gerber files
- Understanding PCB layers and board design

⚠️ This project is based on a tutorial and not tested in hardware.

 📁 Structure
- `pcb/` – KiCad PCB layout
- `gerber/` – Gerber + drill files for fabrication
- `images/` – Screenshots of schematic/PCB/3D view
